## Links

You will commonly come across the following types of links:
●● Links from one website to another
●● Links from one page to another on the same website
●● Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page
●● Links that open in a new browser window
●● Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone

- Links are created using the `<a>` element.
- The `<a>` element uses the href attribute to indicate the page you are linking to.
- If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
- You can use the id attribute to target elements within a page that can be linked to.


## Layout


* To control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive page layouts.

* To control which element sits on top, you can use the z-index property. Its value is a number, and the higher the number the closer that element is to the front. For example, an element with a z-index of 10 will appear over the top of one with a z-index of 5.


# JS

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).

These statements update the message at the top of the page.
The function acts like a store; it holds the statements that are contained in the curly braces until you are ready to use them.
Those statements are not run until the function is called. The function is only ca lled on the last line of this script.
