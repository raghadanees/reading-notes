## SQL

*SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database. And due to its simplicity, SQL databases provide safe and scalable storage for millions of websites and mobile applications.*

- A relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

### SQL Commands Classification

- Data Definition Language (DDL) : CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE etc.
These commands allow you to create or modify your database structure.

- Data Manipulation Language (DML) : INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
These commands are used to manipulate data stored inside your database.
- Data Query Language (DQL) : SELECT
Used for querying or selecting a subset of data from a database.
- Data Control Language (DCL) : GRANT, REVOKE etc.
Used for controlling access to data within a database, commonly used for granting user
privileges.
- Transaction Control Commands : COMMIT, ROLLBACK etc.
Used for managing groups of statements as a unit of work.

*Besides these, your database management system may give you other sets of commands to work more efficiently or to provide extra features. But it is safe to say that the ones above would be present in almost all DBMSâ€™s you encounter.*
