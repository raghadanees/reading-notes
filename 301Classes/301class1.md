# SMACSS and Responsive Web Design

### Responsive Web Design
*Responsive web design is the practice of building a website suitable to work on every device and every screen size, no matter how large or small, mobile or desktop. Responsive web design is focused around providing an intuitive and gratifying experience for everyone. Desktop computer and cell phone users alike all benefit from responsive websites.*

### What is “Float”?
Float is a CSS positioning property. To understand its purpose and origin, we can look to print design. In a print layout, images may be set into the page such that text wraps around them as needed. This is commonly and appropriately called “text wrap”. Here is an example of that.

### What are floats used for?

Aside from the simple example of wrapping text around images, floats can be used to create entire web layouts.

Floats are also helpful for layout in smaller instances. Take for example this little area of a web page. If we use float for our little avatar image, when that image changes size the text in the box will reflow to accommodate:

*While floats can still be used for layout, these days, we have much stronger tools for creating layout on web pages. Namely, Flexbox and Grid. Floats are still useful to know about because they have some abilities entirely unique to them, which is all covered in this article.*
