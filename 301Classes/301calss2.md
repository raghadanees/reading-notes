# PAIR PROGRAMMING

pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together. At Code Fellows, pair programing is one way we foster a collaborative environment while developing key industry skills.

commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.
*6 Reasons for Pair Programming*
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

# jQuery
- SELECT ELEMENTS
- PERFORM TASKS
- HANDLE EVENTS

*jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript.
It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a
quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler.*

#### BASIC SELECTORS
`* `      >> All elements  

`element `  >> All elements with that element name

#id     >> Elements whose id attribute has the value specified

.class  >> Elements whose cl ass attribute has the value specified

selectorl, selector2 >> Elements that match more than one selector (see also the .add()
method, which is more efficient when combining selections)

#### HIERARCHY
ancestor descendant >> An element that is a descendant of another element (e.g., 1 i a)

parent > child     >> An element that is a direct child of another element (you can use* in
the place of the child to select all child elements of the specified parent)

previous + next    >> Adjacent sibling selector only selects elements that are immediately
followed by the previous element

previous - s ib Zings >> Sibling selector will select any elements that are a sibling of the
previous element
