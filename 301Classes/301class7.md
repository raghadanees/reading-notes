#  REST

- The protocol that is used to get pages from servers to your browser, HTTP, it's capable of all sorts of neat stuff that people ignore for some reason.
 - it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

 - The whole world wide web is built on an architectural style called “REST”. REST provides a definition of a “resource”, which is what those things point to.

 - A web page is a “representation” of a resource. Resources are just concepts. URLs--those things that you type into the browser
 - Those URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere. A browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept. Specifically, the browser asks for the web page representation of the concept.
 - there's this concept that people are calling “Web Services” or "APIs". It means a lot of different things to a lot of different people but the basic concept is that machines could use the web just like people do.
