## Error Handling & Debugging
 *EXECUTION CONTEXT & HOISTING*

 Each time a script enters a new execution context, there are two phases of activity:
1: PREPARE

• The new scope is created

• Variables, functions, and arguments are created

• The value of the this keyword is determined

2: EXECUTE

• Now it can assign values to variables

• Reference functions and run their code

• Execute statements
