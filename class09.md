# Forms and JS Events

### Forms
The best known form on the web is probably the search box that sits right in the middle of Google's homepage.

In addition to enabling users to search, forms also allow users to perform other functions online. You will see forms when registering as a member of a website, when shopping online, and when signing up for newsletters or mailing lists.

*Form Structure*
`<form>`
Form controls live inside a <form> element. This element should always carry the action
attribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too.
`action`
Every <form> element requires an action attribute. Its value is the URL for the page on the
server that will receive the information in the form when it is submitted.
`method`
Forms can be sent using one of two methods: get or post.


*Whenever you want to c XX ollect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a <form> element.*

*Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.*
