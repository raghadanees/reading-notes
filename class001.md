# HTML and css
It Uses Elements to Describe the Structure of Pages HTML pages are text documents.
HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
Tags are often referred to as elements.
Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
Attributes require a name and a value.
To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.

DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
You can add comments to your code between the <!-- and --> markers.
The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
The  <div>  and  <span>  elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
<iframes> cut windows into your web pages through which other pages can be displayed.
The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.
Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for:
- _The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site._
- _A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page._

The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational
blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

` The new HTML5 elements `  indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements).

Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there.

### HTML ONLY
Starting with the HTML layer allows you to focus on the most important thing about your site: its content.
Being plain HTML, this layer should work on all kinds of devices, be accessible to all users, and load quite quickly on slow connections.

### HTML+CSS
Adding the CSS rules in a separate file keeps rules regarding how the page looks away from the content itself.
You can use the same style sheet with all of your site, making your sites faster to load and easier to maintain. Or you can use different style sheets with the same content to create different views of the same data.

### HTML+CSS+JAVASCRIPT
The JavaScript is added last and enhances the usability of the page or the experience of interacting with the si te.
Keeping it separate means that the page still works if the user cannot load or run the JavaScript. You can also reuse the code on severa l pages (making the site faster to load and easier to maintain).

It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.

<p>
The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file).

If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.
