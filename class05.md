* ### To add an image into the page
you need to use an `<img>` element. This is an empty element (which means there is 
no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:

##### src
This tells the browser where it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL pointing to an image on your
own site.

##### alt
This provides a text description of the image which describes the
image if you cannot see it.

##### title
You can also use the title attribute with the `<img>` element to provide additional information about the image.

### To edit th size

#### height
This specifies the height of the image in pixels.
#### width
This specifies the width of the image in pixels.

You should save images at the size you will be using them on the web page and in the appropriate format.

Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

## Color
The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
- rgb values
These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up. 
For example: rgb(100,100,90)
- hex codes
These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red,
green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign. 
For example: #ee3e80
- color names
There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers. 
For example: DarkCyan
