Positioning Elements
Building Blocks
*CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its wn box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.*

### Block-level boxes
- start on a new line and act as the main building blocks of any layout, while 

Examples include:
`<h1> <p> <ul> <li>`
### inline boxes 
- flow between surrounding text. 

Examples include:

`<img> <b> <i>`

You can control how much space each box takes up by setting the width of the boxes (and sometimes the height, too). To separate boxes, you can use borders, margins, padding, and background colors.
