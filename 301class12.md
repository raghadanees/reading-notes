## EJS PARTIALS

## Components

*Partials come in handy when you want to reuse the same HTML across multiple views. Think of partials as functions, they make large websites easier to maintain as you don’t have to go and change a piece of text in every page it appears in. Instead, you define that reusable bundle of code in a file andinclude it wherever you need it.*

- the same navigation bar and footer appear in both the home and post view. This makes them perfect candidates for partials!

#### Let’s go ahead and create those partials. Under the views/partials/ directory create a file called navbar.ejs which will contain only the HTML for the navigation bar at the top of the home and post pages:


`<!-- views/partials/navbar.ejs -->`

    `<div class="header clearfix">`

        <nav>`

          `<ul class="nav nav-pills pull-right">`

              ` <li role="presentation"><a href="/">Home</a></li>`

           ` </ul>`

           ` <h3 class="text-muted">Node.js Blog</h3>`

        </nav>

    `</div>`


 #### and a file called footer.ejs in that same directory:
 
`<!-- views/partials/footer.ejs -->`

    `<footer class="footer">`

        `<p>© 90210 Lawyer Stuff.</p>`

    `</footer>`

*Now that we have our partials defined, we can use them in our home.ejs and post.ejs templates! In EJS, any JavaScript or non-HTML syntax you include in your templates is always surrounded by <% %> delimiters (you could change these delimiters if you really wanted to).*


## Linking Partials in Templates
 

<% include templateName %>

This new command include is telling Express to pull the contents of the named template and place it in place of this command.

 

<%- include("partials/header.ejs") %>
