### map and reduce 
*The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element. calls the provided function once for each element in an array, in order. and this method does not change the original array.*
*The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in single output value. Your reducer function’s returned value is assigned to the accumulator, whose value is remembered across each iteration throughout the array, and ultimately becomes the final, single resulting value.*

### What is npm?
npm is the world’s largest software registry. Open source developers from every continent use npm to share and borrow packages, and many organizations use npm to manage private development as well.

### What are npm used for?

- Adapt packages of code for your apps, or incorporate packages as they are.
- Download standalone tools you can use right away.
- Run packages without downloading using npx.
- Share code with any npm user, anywhere.
- Restrict code to specific developers.
