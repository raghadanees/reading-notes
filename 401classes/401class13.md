# Bearer Authorization

Bearer Tokens are encoded JSON objects that “bear” or “contain” enough information for the server to assert that any client request that presents a valid token must have originated from a client that has previously authenticated themselves using either Basic or OAuth.
Upon receiving a Bearer Token from a client, the server can decode it, inspect the JSON object inside, look up the appropriate account, and re-authenticate the user in a single lookup.
Also known as token authentication. An HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. THis can be understood as "give access to this token". It is a cryptic string, usually generated by the serverin response to a login request. Authorization: Bearer token

## What is JSON Web Token?
JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

## When should you use JSON Web Tokens?
Here are some scenarios where JSON Web Tokens are useful:

Authorization: This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.

Information Exchange: JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.

## Write the following steps in the correct order:

Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret

Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party

Receive authorization code

Receive access token

Make a request to the access token endpoint

Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint

Make a request to a third-party API endpoint

## Terms
Client ID : At registration the client application is assigned a client ID and a client secret (password) by the authorization server. The client ID and secret is unique to the client application on that authorization server.

Authentication Endpoint : is an authentication mechanism used to verify the identity of a network’s external or remote connecting device.

Access Token Endpoint : an HTTP endpoint that micropub clients can use to obtain an access token given an authorization code.

API Endpoint : a point at which an application program interface (API) – the code that allows two software programs to communicate with each other – connects with the software program.

Authorization Code : used for any transaction or entry that has restrictions on which users are entitled to access.

Access Token : an object encapsulating the security identity of a process or thread.
