# Access Control (ACL)

## Role-based access control

*is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users. It is used by the majority of enterprises with more than 500 employees and can implement mandatory access control (MAC) or discretionary access control (DAC).*

Role-based access control (RBAC) is a policy-neutral access-control mechanism defined around roles and privileges. The components of RBAC such as role-permissions, user-role and role-role relationships make it simple to perform user assignments. A study by NIST has demonstrated that RBAC addresses many needs of commercial and government organizations . RBAC can be used to facilitate administration of security in large organizations with hundreds of users and thousands of permissions. Although RBAC is different from MAC and DAC access control frameworks, it can enforce these policies without any complication.

### Benefits of RBAC?
With the proper implementation of RBAC, the assignment of access rights becomes systematic and repeatable. Further, it is much easier to audit user rights, and to correct any issues identified.

RBAC may sound intimidating, but it can in reality be easy to implement, and will make the ongoing management of access rights much easier and more secure.

The data breach you prevent may be your own.

## RBAC implementation 
1. Inventory your systems
2. Analyze your workforce and create roles
3. Assign people to roles
4. Never make one-off changes
5. Audit

When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization? Basic authorization is the simplest version of authorization and the least secure. It may be used for a read only resource, and it should only be used with HTTPS because the encryption can be easily reversed. Bearer authoriztion uses a token and is more secure for an exchange between a client and a server.

What does the JSON Web Token package do?
It defines packages for securely transmitting information as a JSON object. It is can be signed with a secret, whcih certifies that the only owner of the secret is the party the signed the JWT.

What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
It is best to make a secret that is random and unguessable. It should be stored in the .env file, though there may be some better options. The goal with a secret is to make sure nobody has access to it, to keep your app secure.
