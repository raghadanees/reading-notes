## Javascript Templating Language and Engine— Mustache.js with Node and Express

### Javascript Templating
*Javascript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with Javascript by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.*
*The template engine then replaces variables and instances declared in a template file with actual values at runtime, and convert the template into an HTML file sent to the client.*

### Mustache
Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code — anything. It works by expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object.
It is often referred to as “logic-less” because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags. Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values.

`Mustache.render(“Hello, {{name}}”, { name: “Sherlynn” });`
`// returns: Hello, Sherlynn`

## Properties for the Parent
(flex container)
display
This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children.

`.container {`
  `display: flex; /* or inline-flex */`
`}`

flex-direction
*This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.*

`.container {`
  `flex-direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;`
`}`

row (default): left to right in ltr; right to left in rtl
row-reverse: right to left in ltr; left to right in rtl
column: same as row but top to bottom
column-reverse: same as row-reverse but bottom to top

### FLEXBOX
- flex-start: Items align to the left side of the container.
- flex-end: Items align to the right side of the container.
- center: Items align at the center of the container.
- space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.
- space-around: Items display with equal spacing around them.
#### For example, justify-content: flex-end; will move the frog to the right.
